# **App Name**: NeuroGrip

## Core Features:

- Finger Actuation: Control system using Arduino/ESP32 to manage a solenoid valve and air pump, enabling the soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) to bend and extend the fingers.
- Grip Strength Measurement: Flex sensors or pressure sensors to accurately measure the user's grip strength in real-time.
- Adaptive Assist AI: AI powered tool to continuously learn the patient's current strength and adjust the robot's assistance level, promoting active-assist therapy.
- Gamified Therapy: Interactive game environment within a web or Unity-based app where grip strength translates to game input.
- User Progress Tracking: Dashboard displaying user progress, therapy hours and grip strength improvements over time. Web pages will be rendered via Github pages, which anyone can view
- Customizable Exercise Programs: Ability for therapists to customize exercise programs and track patients progress. Web pages will be rendered via Github pages, which anyone can view

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calming blue (#72BCD4) to inspire confidence and reliability.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated light blue (#E0F7FA).
- Accent color: Analogous cyan (#4DB6AC) to contrast with primary and highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Consistent use of minimalist icons for therapy exercises and progress indicators.
- Clean, intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy, optimized for patients of all ages.
- Smooth animations that reward successful repetitions and provide gentle guidance.
