/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all data is nested under a user's unique ID (`/users/{userId}`). This ensures that by default, users can only access their own information, providing strong data privacy for patients and therapists.
 *
 * Data Structure: The database is organized around a top-level `users` collection. Each user document serves as the root for their specific data, such as a `patient` or `therapist` profile. Therapists own `exercisePrograms`, which contain `exercises`. Patients assigned to a program can create `progressRecords` for those exercises, which are stored under the therapist's data tree but are owned by the patient.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default. Access must be granted explicitly.
 * - Strict Ownership: All data is owned by a user. Rules for subcollections are based on the ownership of the root user document in the path.
 * - Shared Access for Patients: Patients are granted read-only access to exercise programs and exercises they have been assigned to. This is managed via a denormalized `patientIds` array on the `ExerciseProgram` document. Patients cannot list all of a therapist's programs.
 * - Patient-Owned Progress: Patients create and own their `progressRecords`. While stored under a therapist's program structure for organizational purposes, only the patient can create, update, or delete their own records. The therapist has read-only access for monitoring.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: To enable efficient and secure access, authorization data is denormalized. The `ExerciseProgram` document contains a `patientIds` array. This avoids complex and non-performant queries in security rules, allowing a simple check to see if a patient has been granted access.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: User data is strictly segregated. Patient and Therapist profiles are in separate subcollections under `/users/{userId}`. This prevents data leakage and simplifies rules by ensuring all documents within a given path share the same security context.
